<!-- Google Books Project (Wed 30th):



Each book in the grid should have an image, author, title and description
The grid should be responsive on different screen sizes
You should use async / await for your request code, NOT .then
Styling (required):
This application should look good, take some time to pick a palette and plan out your design. You can use tools like figma or wireframe pro to plan what your application is going to look like.
Styling must use BEM, and each block should have it's own SCSS file
Your palette should use variables
Application Design (required):
You should separate dom functions and non-dom functions in different modules
Example: https://github.com/chillcaw/el-salvador-code-alongs/tree/master/js-modules
Write as many non-dom functions as you can
Functions should do 1 thing, and should be as pure and reusable as possible
Always use iterators over loops
Always parametrise and abstract large pieces of duplicate code.
Bonus (optional, but highly recommended):
Give feedback to the user when no book results can be found for the query.
When a user clicks a book in the grid, a modal should appear with more book information, think about release, publish date, country, languages, etc.
